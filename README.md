# spaceshipHunt
This is my indie game.
The goal of the game is to hunt the opponent spaceship while flying thorough obstacles and enemy spacecrafts, all that need to be done before the time will run out. 
Movment:
pc-WASD or controller left joystick. 
mobile-virtual joystick
Attack:
pc-Enter key or right trigger with joystick.
mobile-fire button GUI.
